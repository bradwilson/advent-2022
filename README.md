# Advent of Code 2022

This project includes an implementation of the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) problems, implemented in .NET 6 and C# 10.

Video playlist of the live streams of solutions: [Advent of Code 2022 Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtiSGQKEdIWymZ0orU36tEBWPi0e4pwrK)

_Note: The code checked into the repository here is often cleaned up after the video is complete, to better clarify the essence of the problem, reduce duplication, and improve readability. The video streams show the live coding process that I do in order to get the best possible score, but do not include the code cleanup._
